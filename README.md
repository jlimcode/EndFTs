## Description

This 🤐🤐 Twitter 🐦 😩😩 😩🐦 bot 🤖🤖 🤖🏋 is 🤚👏 activated upon 🙁💰 ☝ being 😯 📈😑 😩 tagged in 🕒🏻 😂 👏 a ⛄🍖 🅰 response 🎉🎉 🎉🎉 to 🙌💦 💦🙅 🐚📬 a 🚞 👌🎉 🀄 tweet. 🤔🤔 🤔 It 😼😩 will 💦 🅱💰 then 🙄💯 💦🔙 make 📝👏 📣📝 the 👈👏 🏠 😆☸ original 🤔 💯 tweeter angry 😡 😡 by 😈🚗 😈 taking 👉😂 ✋✋ stealing 👏 👏 their 🅾 profile 🚟 🚟🚟 picture and ➕😩 🙋 turning 🙌🙌 💫🙌 it ✔ 😶🔄 into 🤔 our 💩💩 own 😎 🅱♂ 🎡🏻 NFT. 

This 😎 🍉♂ is 👏💯 🕤🤔 particularly effective when ⏰ the 👏 😩👏 original tweeter is 👏❤ ☺👏 🤔🈁 a 🎁 👌 💰 typical 👈 🏃 NFT enjoyer. We 👓 👮 believe 💭 ⁉🙏 😨 in 😩 🏡👻 ⬅ people 👶👪 🏻🤷 not 🚫❌ being able 💪 💪 💪💪 to 😔💦 💦🤔 lord 👨 ⚖🛐 themselves 👨 👩👨 over 👏 ⤵ their ✉ 🤡 🍆🔟 peers 👨 due 👅👅 👅👅 👅👅 to ➡ ⬆💦 some 💛😩 🍯 monetary achievements. Furthermore, we 👴👫 🔨 😱👴 do 👉🤦 👎 💕 not 💪👏 🙅♂ 😅 believe 🙏 😲🙌 minting an ✒👏 NFT is 💦 a 👌 true 💦 😤💯 👍👉 achievement that ⚠ should 💘💘 signify social 💻 💑💰 status. 

🙋🙋 While 👶 🕗 🕑👱 it 🅱 ✊😍 makes ⚙💘 no 🏳 ♂ difference ❗ if 💀👏 💦 one 😤 ☝ simply 😡 😡 😡 screenshots an 🅰 😘 NFT bro's 😁 😍 👊 profile 🚟🚟 🚟🚟 picture, 🦊 📷🦊 🦊 we 🏃 🏃 believe 😱 🤔🏻 that 🚟 👅🤔 their 🔟 👏⬅ true 💯💀 ☑ pride 💰 arises in 👏 the 😈 👌🌊 ability 👉👉 👉👉 👉👉 to 🏿 click 🖱🖱 🖱 🖱 five 🖐 🖐 buttons 🖱 🖱 🖱 to 🚟💦 💯 mint or 🅱😩 💰🚨 💰😇 claim 🏾👏 👏 their NFT. The 🤡🌊 👏 ✝ only 🙌 🏼 💳 barrier to ⏸ 😖 every 😤👖 ⏱ single person 🚫♀ 🙌🚫 owning 💥 👊 an 😚🏻 👹📯 NFT is 🔥📃 the 💦💦 📑 ability 👉 to 😘 👂😔 💦💦 figure out 💰📤 what 😅😦 🤔💦 🤔🤔 gas 😤😤 😤 😤 conversions are. 

😊🏻 👌 This 🕺👉 will 😩 👊⚽ 👏 be 🐝 😠👎 an 👹 👹 important 🤣😍 ✅ ❌🤣 step 📈👞 👉 👞 in ♂📥 ✔ democratizing the world of 😿 ♨ distributed finance.
